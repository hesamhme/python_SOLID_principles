# SOLID Principles in Python

This repository contains simple examples of the SOLID principles implemented in Python. The SOLID principles are a set of design guidelines that help developers create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software.

## SOLID Principles Overview

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - A class should have only one reason to change. This means that a class should only have one job or responsibility.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. This means that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means that a client should never be forced to implement an interface it doesnâ€™t use.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This means that the dependencies among modules should be managed by interfaces or abstract classes.
